# Peau de taupe
> The task and organization system for Vim

Peau de taupe (mole skin in french) is a Vim plugin that adds shortcuts to a special text file. Those shortcuts help manage a daily organization system in Vim. Inspired by the Bullet Journal among other system, but to save the mole from hipster rage it is only digital ;)

## Installation
It is a vim plugin so install it like the others. I hope you are using a package manager like pathogen.

## How to use
Still needs a few tweaks...
